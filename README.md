# CryptoClustering

## Code Sources  
No additional code sources were used in this challenge.  

NOTE: Since I consolidated the elbow method and clustering plots into two functions, the KMeans cluster predictions, DataFrame reviews, and plots will all display in the same output block. Be careful not to miss them.
